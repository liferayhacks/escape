Feature: Running the build phase 
    As a Infrastructure engineer
    In order to validate my changes
    I need to be able to build a project locally

    Scenario: Build the default Escape plan
      Given a new Escape plan called "my-release"
      When I build the application
      Then "_/my-release" version "0.0.0" is present in the build state

    Scenario: Build with default input variables
      Given a new Escape plan called "my-release"
        And input variable "input_variable" with default "test"
        And input variable "input_variable2" with default "test2"
      When I build the application
      Then "_/my-release" version "0.0.0" is present in the build state
       And its calculated input "input_variable" is set to "test"
       And its calculated input "input_variable2" is set to "test2"

    Scenario: Default input variables update on every build
      Given a new Escape plan called "my-release"
        And input variable "input_variable" with default "test"
        And I build the application
        And "_/my-release" version "0.0.0" is present in the build state
        And its calculated input "input_variable" is set to "test"
        And input variable "input_variable" with default "new default baby"
      When I build the application
      Then "_/my-release" version "0.0.0" is present in the build state
       And its calculated input "input_variable" is set to "new default baby"

    Scenario: Default build with dependencies
      Given a new Escape plan called "my-dependency"
        And I release the application
        And a new Escape plan called "my-second-dependency"
        And it has "my-dependency-latest" as a dependency 
        And I release the application
        And a new Escape plan called "my-release"
        And it has "my-second-dependency-latest" as a dependency 
      When I build the application
      Then "_/my-release" version "0.0.0" is present in the build state
       And "_/my-second-dependency" version "0.0.0" is present in its deployment state

    Scenario: Default input variables update for dependencies on every build
      Given a new Escape plan called "my-input-dependency"
        And input variable "input_variable" with default "test"
        And I release the application
        And a new Escape plan called "my-release"
        And it has "my-input-dependency-latest" as a dependency 
        And I build the application
        And "_/my-release" version "0.0.0" is present in the build state
        And "_/my-input-dependency" version "0.0.0" is present in its deployment state
        And its calculated input "input_variable" is set to "test"
        And input variable "input_variable" with default "new default baby"
      When I build the application
      Then "_/my-release" version "0.0.0" is present in the build state
       And "_/my-input-dependency" version "0.0.0" is present in its deployment state
       And its calculated input "PREVIOUS_input_variable" is set to "test"
       And its calculated input "input_variable" is set to "new default baby"
